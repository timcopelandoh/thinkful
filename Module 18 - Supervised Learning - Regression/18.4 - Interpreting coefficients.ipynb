    "expenditure is the annual spending on recreation in US dollars, annual_income is the annual income in US dollars, and have_kids is a dummy variable indicating the families with children. Interpret the estimated coefficients. What additional statistics should be given in order to make sure that your interpretations make sense statistically. Write up your answer.\n",

    "For every $1 increase in a familiy's income, the dependent variable increases by the derivative (wrt annual_income), which is .00004*annual_income +.0012. So if a family's income changes from $50,000 to $50,001, the family will spend .00002*50000+.0012 = $1.0012 more on expenditures (the model might need some tweaking). \n",
